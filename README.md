# A 3D model of the false door ofPtahshepses

Limestone false-door and architrave of Ptahshepses: the architrave, which is carved in fine, detailed, sunk relief, contains five lines of text consisting of standard invocation-formulae to Osiris and Anubis. The false door consists of the false door proper with two lines of text on each side containing the titles of Ptahshepses, flanked on both sides by panelled walls carrying the biographical inscription of Ptahshepses in which he describes his birth in the time of Mycerinus, his marriage to Khamaat, a princess and daughter, probably, of Shepseskaf, and his career under four further kings, continuing down, probably, to Nyuserre of the Fifth Dynasty.
